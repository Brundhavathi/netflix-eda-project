# Netflix Titles Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Project Overview
***This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Netflix Titles dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook.  

***It focuses on understanding the distribution of Movies and TV Shows on Netflix, trends in content release years, genre popularity, country-wise production, and rating categories.  

***Through visualizations and data cleaning steps, the project uncovers meaningful insights that help explain how Netflix’s content library has evolved over time.  

***The analysis is implemented entirely in Jupyter Notebook using libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and plotly.  

***This project is part of my data analysis portfolio, demonstrating my ability to clean datasets, perform exploratory analysis, create visualizations, and draw insights from real-world data.
